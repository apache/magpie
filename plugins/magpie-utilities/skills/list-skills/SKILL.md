  Print a human-readable index of every skill installed for this
  repository, grouped by the family each one declares, with the
  name to invoke it by and the first sentence of its
  `description`. Discovery is installation-aware: it covers a
  pinned snapshot install, the framework checkout, and
  marketplace plugin installs, so the index matches what the
  agent can actually run. Generated on every run from live
  `SKILL.md` frontmatter, so it never goes stale when skills are
  added, removed, or rewritten.
when_to_use: |
  Invoke when a human asks *"what skills are available"*, *"list
  the skills"*, *"show me the skills in this repo"*, *"give me a
  table of contents for the skills"*, or invokes it under
  whichever name their install method uses.
  Skill names differ on this install:
  `/magpie-utilities:list-skills` on a marketplace family-plugin
  install, `/magpie-list-skills` on the pinned snapshot.
  This is a help-style overview for humans onboarding to the
  repository — agents route via the live frontmatter
  `description` field directly and do not need this index to
  choose a skill.

<!-- BEGIN MAGPIE PREFLIGHT — generated from tools/dev/preflight-block.md -->

## Pre-flight — is this project set up?

Do this **first, before anything else in this skill**, and do it silently: a
couple of file checks, or one CLI call for a marketplace install.

**This block decides one thing: whether to stay silent.** Each step either
passes silently or sends you to `preflight-detail.md` — a file in this
skill's own directory, alongside this one — which carries that step's branch
handling, the rules constraining it, and the reasoning. The text here is
deliberately not enough to act on: **never act on a non-silent outcome
without reading that file first.** If it cannot be read, say so and continue
into the work the user asked for rather than improvising the branch.

1. **Is a lock present?** If `.apache-magpie.lock` exists, read its
   `method`.

2. **A snapshot method** (`svn-zip` / `git-tag` / `git-branch`) → compare
   with `.apache-magpie.local.lock`. Both present and agreeing on
   `ref` / `commit` → **silent**; continue. Anything unresolved → *detail,
   step 2*.

3. **`method: marketplace`** → the lock is the project's **floor**: a
   minimum version and a minimum plugin set, never a pin. Compare the
   machine against it.

   **First, check `url`.** If it is anything other than `apache/magpie`,
   run **nothing** → *detail, step 3*.

   Otherwise read the installed state — `claude plugin list --json`, or
   the running agent's equivalent. **An empty or unreadable result is
   unknown, never absent**: run nothing, propose nothing, say nothing,
   and carry on to step 4. Only a result the session actually read drives
   anything. Compare **as PEP 440, not as strings**, with no special
   handling for a `.devN` segment.

   - every floor plugin installed at or above `min_version` →
     **silent**; continue the skill;
   - anything else — a plugin absent, a plugin below `min_version`, or no
     such CLI to read → *detail, step 3*.

   **Never** remove a plugin, downgrade one, pin the marketplace to a tag,
   or touch a plugin absent from the floor. Being *ahead* of the floor is
   the normal case and is not a finding.

4. **Compare this skill's fingerprint against the reconciliation stamp.**
   Not install-method-specific, unlike step 3: it runs the same way for
   every `method`, and whether or not there is a lock. Skip it entirely —
   silent, no reads — when any of these holds:

   - none of `.apache-magpie.lock`, `.apache-magpie-local/` or
     `.apache-magpie-overrides/` exists: nothing has ever been configured,
     so there is nothing to reconcile;
   - step 3 ended in a state step 5 stops the run for — but **an *unknown*
     step 3 result is not one of those**, and this step runs normally
     after it;
   - this skill's own `surface_hash` is not in the context you were given:
     a check that cannot read its own input says nothing rather than
     guessing.

   Otherwise look this skill's frontmatter `name:` up in the lock's
   `reconciled.skills` map, already open from step 1 — no extra read.
   **Found and equal → silent**, and nothing else here needs a read.
   Anything else — differing, absent from the map, or no lock at all →
   *detail, step 4*.

5. **Unless step 3 passed silently or came back unknown, stop.** The
   session is still below the project's floor and has to be restarted
   before this command is re-run; *detail, step 5* has what to say. An
   unknown result carries no such action — nothing to say, nothing to
   restart for — so continue.

6. **No lock?** Then this is the marketplace install without adoption,
   or nothing at all. That is a supported end state, not a fault — what
   matters is whether *this skill's* configuration resolves.

7. **Resolve this skill's `requires_config:` frontmatter.** Each file,
   per the lookup chain: `.apache-magpie-local/<file>` (gitignored,
   personal) first, then `.apache-magpie-overrides/<file>` (committed).
   All present → **silent**, carry on.

   Any required file missing → **run `/magpie-setup config` for this
   skill now**, say that you are doing it and why, then continue into the
   work the user actually asked for. Two things it may not do: **fabricate
   a value** — anything it cannot derive from the repository is a question
   it asks or a `TODO` it leaves — and **continue past a value it needs
   but does not have**. Why running it unasked is safe, and why it needs
   no restart → *detail, step 7*.

8. **Never run `/magpie-setup adopt` unattended** — not here, not later
   in the run, whatever else this skill is doing. It commits a
   recommendation for every contributor and is the maintainers' decision.
   If step 7 just wrote configuration → *detail, step 8*.

Steps 9 and 10 are settled at the **end** of the run, not in pre-flight.
Both are silent in the ordinary case; each names what would make it speak.

9. **Propose vetting the reads.** While you work, note each operation that
   stopped for a confirmation prompt. Nothing prompted, or every one was a
   write → say nothing. Any that were **read-only** → *detail, step 9*.

10. **Suggest `/magpie-setup verify` when it is overdue.** Compare today
    against the most recent of `verified_at` and `verify_suggested_at` in
    `.apache-magpie-local/reconciled.json` — already read in step 4 if that
    step read it — falling back to the stamp's `at:`. Inside
    `setup.verify_interval_days` (default 14, `0` disables) → say nothing.
    Older → *detail, step 10*.

Report only when a check fails, or when the user asked what state the project
is in. `/magpie-setup verify` is the full diagnostic.

<!-- END MAGPIE PREFLIGHT -->

Print a human-readable index of the skills installed for this
repository. The index is generated on every run from live
`SKILL.md` frontmatter — there is no cached copy to keep in sync.
The skill exists for humans (newcomers reading the repo,
maintainers checking what is available); agents route invocations
via the same frontmatter the script reads, so this skill is
purely informational.

What counts as "installed" depends on how Magpie was put in
place, so the script covers all three shapes and labels which one
each entry came from:

| Install | Where the skills live | Invocation shown |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned snapshot | `.agents/skills/` plus the per-agent relays beside it | `/magpie-<skill>` |
| Framework checkout | the repo's own `skills/` | `/magpie-<skill>` |
| Marketplace plugin | the plugin cache this script runs from, and its sibling plugins | `/<plugin>:<skill>` |

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ on `PATH`. Nothing else — the script is
  stdlib-only, as `skills/pyproject.toml` requires of every
  helper script in this tree, and declares that contract in
  [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline metadata.
  `uv run --script` and a bare `python3` therefore behave
  identically.

---

## Step 1 — Run the listing script

Run the bundled script and present its output to the user
verbatim:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/magpie-list-skills/scripts/list_skills.py
```

Run that command **literally**, as written — do not expand it to
an absolute path. It is a repository-relative path that resolves
under both install methods that put skills in the repository: a
pinned snapshot install and the framework checkout both carry
`.claude/skills/magpie-list-skills` as a symlink onto the real
skill directory.

For a layout that puts each description on its own indented line
(easier to read when descriptions are long), pass `--verbose`; to
inspect a repository other than the enclosing one, pass `--root`:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/magpie-list-skills/scripts/list_skills.py --verbose
python3 .claude/skills/magpie-list-skills/scripts/list_skills.py --root /path/to/repo
```

**Marketplace installs are the one exception.** They write nothing
into the repository, so that path does not exist — the skill lives
in the plugin cache. Build the command from the base directory
reported for this skill instead:

```bash
python3 <the base directory reported for this skill>/scripts/list_skills.py
```

The script:

- resolves the repository from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
  (or `--root`), **not** from its own location — under a
  per-family plugin install its own location is one family, not
  the whole install;
- walks the agent-target directories that install writes into
  (`.agents/skills/` and its relays — the registry in
  [`../../../magpie-setup/skills/setup/agents.md`](../../../magpie-setup/skills/setup/agents.md) is the source of
  truth), the framework's own `skills/` when the repo is the
  framework checkout, and the sibling plugins in the marketplace
  cache when it is running from one;
- de-duplicates by the name you would type, so relay directories
  collapse to one entry while a skill available from *two*
  install methods keeps both — they are two different things to
  type;
- groups by each skill's declared `family:` frontmatter key, per
  Golden rule 8. Family is **never** inferred from the name
  prefix: `repo-health` and `contributor-growth` span several
  prefixes, and `write-skill` is family `utilities`, not family
  `write`. A skill that declares no family lands in `other`;
- prints each entry with the first sentence of its description,
  then a summary of which install each entry came from.

---

## Step 2 — Hand the output to the user

Quote the script output back to the user as-is. Do not
paraphrase, summarise, or re-order — the value of this skill is
that the listing is the canonical, deterministic view of what
exists. If the user asks for more detail on a specific skill,
read that skill's `SKILL.md` and answer from it.

---

## Hard rules

- **Read-only.** This skill never edits, creates, or deletes
  files. It only reads `SKILL.md` files under the install
  directories listed above.
- **No paraphrasing.** Always present the script output verbatim.
  Paraphrasing reintroduces the staleness this skill exists to
  prevent.
