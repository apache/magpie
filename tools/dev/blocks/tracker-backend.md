Read `tracker.platform` from `<project-config>/project.md` (default `github`) before the first tracker operation.
With `github`, every recipe below runs as written.
With `local-files` or `jira`, never run a `gh` command against `<tracker>`:
look the command up in the [skill-command → vetted-operation table](../../../../tools/security-tracker/contract.md#from-skill-commands-to-vetted-operations)
and run that vetted operation instead — `vetted-op-read` for reads, `vetted-op-tracker` for the rollup, body-field and publish operations, `vetted-op` for the other writes.
Vetted-ops translates it for the configured backend; `<tracker>` issue numbers become the backend's IDs, and the returned `url` is the link.
Operations on `<upstream>` (PRs, code search) do not change.
A refusal — the backend's confidentiality guard, or an operation the backend does not have — stops the step: report it, never route around it.

**Publish local tracker changes before ending.** With `local-files`, nothing reaches the team until it is committed.
If this run wrote to the tracker, run the `tracker-pending` vetted operation as the last step, show the changed files,
draft a commit message naming the trackers and the action, ending with the project's commit-attribution trailer, and ask.
Only on the user's confirmation run `tracker-publish` with that message file
(Git: commit the tracker folder and push; SVN: commit, which publishes).
